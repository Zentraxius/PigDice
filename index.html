        <p>The game of Pig Dice may seem simple, but it is a test of greed, luck, and strategy.</p>
        <p>Each player may roll as many times as they want on their turn, and save their roll at any time, rolling 2 1d6 dice.</p>
        <p>If at any point you roll a 1, on either of your dice, your turn is forcibly ended and your score for that turn is 0</p>
        <p>Will you take your low roll and guaranteed points? Or will you try to push for the maximum score of 12 in a turn?</p>
        <p>When player1 has ended their turn, regardless of score, player2 will begin their turn under the same rules</p>
        <p>First player to score a total of 100 or more wins!</p>
